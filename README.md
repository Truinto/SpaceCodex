This is my little sandbox. I usually keep this private. But I did find it very annoying that the game would lock you out of Foulstone, if you take the evil option. So here is how to colonize after the fact:
* Install mod
* Go to and click the planet 'Foulstone' located in the 'Trinnitos' system
* Press CTRL+F10 to bring up the mod manager
* Press the hamburger menu of SpaceCodex (that's the three lines that open the options of the mod)
* Press the only button 'Unlock foulstone'
* Done; you can save and uninstall the mod now
